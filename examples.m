% Example code to model non-planar surface contacts and its application in
% grasping. The pipeline includes:
% 1. Contact profile 
% 2. Friction computation
% 3. Fit limit surfaces
% 4. Multi-contacts and applications in grasping 

%% Contact Profile: surface geometry and pressure distribution
% 3 types of surface are available: parametric surfaces, meshed surface, 
% and arbitrary surfaces from FEM simulations

% Example: meshed surface
